Crying before masturbating is such a weird concept. 
You’re crying cause you’re sad &amp; really unhappy.
You masturbate cause that will bring some kind of relief/catharsis.
But you know once you finish then you’ll be sad again &amp; it ultimately ruins the action for you.

But I'm depressed as fuck and just want the sun to stop disappearing at 4 PM!|%&|
@balletnbulimia Being depressed doesn’t have anything to do with materialistic items. It’s a mental illness, it’s in the mind. If you ever need to talk pls don’t hesitate to text me, I’m here for you 💕💕|%&|
i have given you so many hints that i’m depressed, why can’t you see it? 
:(
i need you &lt;/3|%&|
I’m so depressed, I need my hair done|%&|
tell me why i don’t really want to stay at home anymore. this isn’t even funny i get so depressed when i’m here. this is why some people need to stop assuming that students want to go home and want to stay home|%&|
@jarpad I HATED the ending Jared. I literally feel disgusted, horrified, depressed, and utterly furious with the writers. I thought the 2nd to the last episode was a great ending, but no CW must hate fans. After 15 years, I needed a good ending. I need clarity. I'm heart broken...💔|%&|
@laurenboebert 
I just drove through Parachute, Silt and Rifle.  That area is depressed and in sore need of some help.  What are your plans?|%&|
I don't need anybody's fucking money or influence 😏
Im young, savage and true! 
I'm from Enugu ⛰
I play basketball so I know what value system is and how it works in real life.  
I have a message for the Depressed nigerian youth

i no longer have to live my life afraid i'll forget everything tomorrow.
paps is still here.. and i'm happy.

Me: so if I clean my room I'll feel less depressed
My depression: yes
Me: so I'm gonna clean my room
My depression: no
Me: but I need to
My depression: yes
Me: so I'm going to
My depression: no|%&|
@sweetie_sunset in the video I was watching.. it said one of the symptoms of autism was depression, that explains why I'm so freaking depressed all the time...

I need to do more research....|%&|
Just finished up chapter 6 and I'm depressed as fuck now. Fuck, man... I need a break. https://t.co/J81YJut57J|%&|
I spend money when I’m stressed, hungry, happy, depressed, etc. I need to find a new hobby cause this 1 making me broke https://t.co/YvBUwqBAP9|%&|
@ElfieGoldbergi1 Maybe I need glasses,  I don't see the father in the photo , I'm shocked 😁. Absolutely disgusting to pollute the gene pool, but if her values are that low , she's obviously not among the finest of WH.ITES, still sad to see this they all look depressed.|%&|
My heart is shattered, my soul weak... This crazy fear of people abandoning me results in me pushing them away when I need them most or clinging so tight they suffocate and run away anyway 🥺 #Borderline #bpd #abandoned #RUNAWAY #leave  #DepressionIsReal #depressed #help|%&|
Came back from vacation and I’m slightly depressed... I can’t live life like this. I need bigger! I need more!|%&|
i need to stop drinking when I’m depressed|%&|
i can tell i’m getting really depressed because i am letting myself go 

i don’t do skincare anymore, i don’t care if i shower and i don’t care if i shave... 

all i need is to stop caring if my room gets messy and it will be time to prepare the depression nest|%&|
I'm deactivating again in 10 minutes everything that's happened is just a lot to take in and it's getting me stressed and depressed. I'll be okay, I need some time to myself.|%&|
Dear Parents, 
   If your kid tells you they are depressed/have depression and then they say they “fell better” after talking to you; they don’t actually feel better. They just realized they will never actually help them when they need help. #NoNuanceNovember|%&|
"you don't need the redbull then"
"no, no, i do, i'm very depressed"

@freelygive365 @AleeShaw_ Congrats wish I could get even $20 to get stuff I need like meds I’m down and out and depressed|%&|
@JackBear62 I may look happy, confident and strong but I'm really very tired, full of doubts and constantly seriously depressed. But if you need a cheerleader I'm your girl|%&|
@ade_w17 @MusicMarketingA @MindCharity @samaritans @mentalhealthuk Here was the article I saw on suicide rates amongst musicians. I'm adding it now because of all the people that are depressed this time of year-we need to get through it! 1 is too many, so yes, 100 is concerning.. https://t.co/ZeGVJt9jH0|%&|
i can’t be the only person who gets so depressed and goes into my room and play a sad playlist just to make me cry harder and after all that, goes outside and smile at everyone and say “i’m fine” when i just really need a hug and need everyone to understand me...|%&|
BTW Luke it’s not “ok” to feel depressed. Depression is another form of pain. To help heal a person you first need to acknowledge that person’s pain. We call it empathy. It seems to me you call it opportunity. We are not a cauldron of molecules we are humans. https://t.co/VlTlfiDFC0|%&|
@yeralizard My friend and I were talking earlier and she said “I need to figure out if I’m PMSing or am actually depressed.”|%&|
@buckyslvpin who is it? do i need to throw hands, i’ll do it if needed after i’m done being depressed|%&|
I need to get groceries but every time I go grocery shopping I end up throwing 1/2 of what I purchase away because I HATE MY TINY KITCHEN &amp; I’m too depressed to cook pls send help|%&|
@SopeMeYall I'm also an idiot and a clown most of the time, but sometimes I get into this depressed mood and I need someone to help me get up|%&|

@ambvrrose_ you’re not alone. I’ve been having the best week ever for the first time all year after being depressed af and then today I woke up full of anxiety and dread. But we will get through this. I believe in you. And I believe in me. I’m here if you need anything 💕|%&|
@SouthernCoca Then taking them off), and everything else is easy peasy to assemble. We keep the garland up all year for those rainy gloomy days when I’m depressed &amp; need a reason to smile. I love the little lights, obviously, which is why everything is out by Nov 1 https://t.co/Qq34NHGcIt|%&|
THE PSALM:
I need God
I cry to God
where is God?
God is nowhere
I’m angry at God
I’m hiding in a cave
I want to die
people hate me
I’m depressed
I’m depressed
but I’ll still praise God
God help me

THE HYMN BASED ON THE PSALM:
I need God
I praise God
God is good!

@StevenMcinerney in my opinion de bruyne looks depressed asf on the second goal we had 3 left in defence against a top 5 team why tf is that happening when we know spurs punish with the likes of Kane and son why do they do that. Pep tells Messi to stay at Barca but we fucking need him I’m fed up|%&|
@Sifill_LDF I'm depressed. 

Humanity is doomed due to sheer selfishness and magical thinking. At this point is beginning to look hopeless. 

And we also have the Catholics too, asking SCOTUS for permission to hold their own superspreaders because they need money to maintain their churches.|%&|
@orchidork08 I’ve played some Shinobi Koi in jp and I can guarantee it’s a bundle of ninja joy that people would love. We need some bright, colourful, uplifting games because I’m sure everyone is getting depressed|%&|
@GRD94194730 @Kaoz989 @Krynto17 @ParagonDon605 @StoolGreenie Happy to help! No need to be depressed either. The Jay train has a bright future.|%&|
I know I'm depressed but to what point that what I need to find out!|%&|
Honestly, I have 2 sides in my music I’m either depressed and need to purge my feelings or I’m drunk and high talking about my clit. Multi-Dimensional Queen 💕|%&|
✨I need POWERFUL AILEE to cheer me up when I'm stressed and depressed.
✨I need EMOTIONAL AILEE to calm me down when I'm worried and anxious.
Yah I NEED AILEEMUSIC ALL THE TIME!

🤫Amy, it's your music that always keeps me company and brings me so much comfort when I'm alone!💕 https://t.co/rNyusHPGZ1|%&|
